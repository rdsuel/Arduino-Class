# Arduino-Class
This repo contains the class materials for the "Arduino Basics" class that I teach at General Electric. It will cover multiple examples intended to teach basic concepts needed to program for Arduinos.

## Arduino Software Reference 
We will be using the following Arduino Language Reference page extensively. It defines software structure, variables and functions needed to program for the Arduino.

## Example 1: Blink an LED at 1Hz

### Concepts
Digital Outputs, Timing, Serial Window, Functions

### Schematic
![Example 1](/schematics/example_1.png)

### Details
Connect an LED and current limiting resistor (200 Ohm, blue resistor) to pin 5 of the Arduino Uno. Blink the LED at 1Hz (500ms on, 500ms off). Use functions to encapsulate functionality where possible.
